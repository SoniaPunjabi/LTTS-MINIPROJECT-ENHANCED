## HANGMAN GAME
Hangman is a fun word guessing game where 2 or more players have to guess a word letter by letter until all their chances are over. I have worked on a code for single player Hangman. There are 6 words in a 2 dimensional array. A random index number is generated and the word corresponding to that index number needs to be guessed. As the number of wrong guesses increases the number of lives/chances decreases and platform corresponding to the the number of lives left is printed for every wrong guess.
